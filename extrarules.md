# Extra Rules

## Hay Roll Multiplier

When calculating **Hay** roll payouts in the roll table:

- If Hay quantity is **5–9**, apply a **1.5×** multiplier.
- If Hay quantity is **10+**, apply a **2×** multiplier.
- Otherwise, apply **1×**.

This multiplier affects the **roll payout values** shown in the roll table (profit per roll), not the asset purchase net values.

## Equipment Bonuses

- **Tractors** increase hay gain by **+20% per tractor** additively, up to 5 tractors (+100%).
- **Harvesters** increase grain gain by **+20% per harvester** additively, up to 5 harvesters (+100%).

## Win Condition
